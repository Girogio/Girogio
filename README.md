Hey there, caught you looking around. Might as well introduce myself then.

I'm Giorgio, an undergrad at the [University of Malta](https://um.edu.mt) studying mathematics and computer science. There, I also serve as a student representative on the Board of Studies of the Department of Mathematics. Together with some fellow students, I run the [Malta Mathematical Society](https://www.facebook.com/MaltaMathSoc/), where we focus on the national development of the academic mathematical disciplines.

A notable mention in my life advancement is the startup I founded together with my university companion [Zack Xuereb](https://github.com/Zack-Xb), namely ApplabMT, where we kickstarted in the Web3 ocean. Ever since, we haven't stopped learning and researching ways to improve current blockchains. I also worked with [Dedaub](https://dedaub.com) as an intern.

In my spare time, I like to play CTFs together with some friends, with whom I've had the honour to represent my country in the [ECSC](https://ecsc.eu/). In my spare spare time (if any), I like to research various topics, such as quantum computing/cryptography, graph theory, blockchain analysis â€“ and most importantly how I'm going to integrate them all.
