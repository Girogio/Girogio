Hey there, caught you looking around. Might as well introduce myself then.

I'm Giorgio Grigolo, a student following a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of Malta](https://um.edu.mt), where I also serve as a student representative on the Board of Studies of the Department of Mathematics. Together with fellow students, I run the [Malta Mathematical Society](https://www.facebook.com/MaltaMathSoc/), where we focus on the national development of the academic mathematical disciplines.

In my spare time, I like to play CTF's together with some friends, with whom I've had the honour to represent my country in the [ECSC](https://ecsc.eu/). In my spare spare time (if any), I like to research various topics, such as quantum computing/cryptography, graph theory, blockchain analysis â€“ and most importantly how the hell I'll merge all three.
