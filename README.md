Hi, I'm Giorgio! Thanks for taking interest in my coding endeavours.

Currently, I am following the B.Sc. Mathematics and Computer Science undergraduate course at the [University of Malta](https://um.edu.mt), whilst being an active member of the [Malta Mathematical Society](https://www.facebook.com/MaltaMathSoc/). Furthermore, I am teaching Mathematics (*Ordinary and Intermediate levels*) on a one-to-one basis. I advocate for the usage of free [*(libre)*](https://wikipedia.com/free_software) software whenever possible. Additionally, I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) as my daily driver together with [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/).
