Hey there, caught you looking around. Might as well introduce myself then.

I'm Giorgio Grigolo, a student following a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of Malta](https://um.edu.mt), where I also serve as a student representative on the Board of Studies of the Department of Mathematics. Together with fellow students, I run the [Malta Mathematical Society](https://www.facebook.com/MaltaMathSoc/), where we focus on the national development of the academic mathematical disciplines.

A notable mention in my life advancement is the startup I founded together with my university companion [Zack Xuereb](https://github.com/Zack-Xb), namely Applab Limited, where we kickstarted our dive in the blockchain ecosystem. Ever since, we have not stopped learning and researching ways to improve current chains. Currently we're both employed at renown companies in the blockchain space, becoming every day a better version of ourselves.

In my spare time, I like to play CTF's together with some friends, with whom I've had the honour to represent my country in the [ECSC](https://ecsc.eu/). In my spare spare time (if any), I like to research various topics, such as quantum computing/cryptography, graph theory, blockchain analysis â€“ and most importantly how the hell I can merge all three.
