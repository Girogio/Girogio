- 👋 Hey there, I’m Giorgio &ndash; your average 18 year old. Assuming that the average is exactly what I am. And I'm pretty sure that the previous statement is false.

- 👀 I’m interested in music (not your usual stuff), mathematics, computer science, speed-cubing and mobile app development.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React native, JavaScript and advanced mathematics.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any app concept or ideas you might have and turn them into reality! (check out my portfolio at [giorgiogrigolo.com](https://www.giorgiogrigolo.com))

- 📫 You can contact me by sending an email on `giorgiogrigolo03@gmail.com`
